INTRODUCTION 


The need for a Traffic Control System
Mostly in cities, traffic is becoming a prime problem for day to day life. The current traffic control 
systems in metro cities are inefficient due to randomness in the traffic density pattern. The traffic 
signal timers have a fixed time to switch traffic between different directions. In todayâ€™s era 
controlling traffic has become very arduous because of the increase in automobiles such as cars, 
bikes, etc. 
Due to this, the vehicles have to wait for a long time even if the traffic density is very less. The 
present era controlling traffic became very arduous because of the increase in automobiles such as 
cars, bikes, etc. Due to this, there are long time delays in the signaling systems. To overcome this 
problem, we have designed a density based traffic signal
